List of attendees: http://www.snd.org/2014/10/meet-the-news-nerds-tackling-content-creation-at-sndmakes/


Miranda Mulligan, Chief of KnightLab:  "I want to make audio a more compelling experience in browser-based environments."
* What's the audio version of an animated GIF?  Simple, short, easy, Vine-like but not beholden to any service or platform? (Lisa Williams)


Pete Karl: How might we better accommodate the myriad changes that a story goes through over time?  
* associated media -- audio and photo management 
* Individuals in a story and their relationships
* How can we accommodate the story lifecycle?
* How do we create connections between the content? 
* MM: OpenNews hackathon had a project that Jenny 8. and Eric Price did called NewsDiffs (http://newsdiffs.org/) that tracked changes

Lisa Williams:  How do we take the institutional knowledge that reporters have and make that visible to news consumers and other reporters?
* could we use something like Popolo to express the relationships between newspapers?  Show a newsmaker's network -- and stories about them at a click. 
* Amanda Krauss, Texas Tribune -- "We started out with Popolo but ended up with something very different." 
* Steve McKinney, Vox (Vox uses "card stacks) -- we have streams, we can show a user where this article is along a timeline.  
* Alisha McKinney, Vox -- how might we reinvent the hyperlink -- how can we better give context?
