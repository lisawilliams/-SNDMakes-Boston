**Initial brainstorming session -- Friday, October 17, 10AM EST**

Miranda Mulligan, Chief of KnightLab:  **"I want to make audio a more compelling experience in browser-based environments."**
* What's the audio version of an animated GIF?  Simple, short, easy, Vine-like but not beholden to any service or platform? (Lisa Williams)


Pete Karl, Upstatement -**How might we better accommodate the myriad changes that a story goes through over time?**
* associated media -- audio and photo management 
* Individuals in a story and their relationships
* How can we accommodate the story lifecycle?
* How do we create connections between the content? 
* MM: OpenNews hackathon had a project that Jenny 8. and Eric Price did called NewsDiffs (http://newsdiffs.org/) that tracked changes

Lisa Williams, INN:  **How do we take the institutional knowledge that reporters have and make that visible to news consumers and other reporters?**
* could we use something like Popolo to express the relationships between newspapers?  Show a newsmaker's network -- and stories about them at a click. 
* Amanda Krauss, Texas Tribune -- "We started out with Popolo but ended up with something very different." 
* Steve McKinney, Vox (Vox uses "card stacks) -- we have streams, we can show a user where this article is along a timeline.  
* Alisha McKinney, Vox -- how might we reinvent the hyperlink -- how can we better give context?  
* Problem statement: at small news organizations, when people move on, the reporters do the same stories all over again because there's no effective way to 

Kaeti Hinck, INN: 
*  **How do we bring end users into our editorial decision-making process, particularly around revision?**

Adam Schweigert, INN

**How could we build in docs and howtos into an interface, in a way that gives users gentle nudges to write or compose the stuff we want them to?**
*  "Here's how to crop a photo"  
*  "How might the content creation process create better journalists?"  How can it help you make a better choice, rather than writing something that an editor will come to you and say, wait, write it this way?
*  How about building in headline testing?  
*  Tito Bottita, Upstatement:  At Buzzfeed, when you try to author an item, it will show you what makes a good Buzzfeed post or headline.  (Lisa Williams: Mailchimp does this too -- it lets you test email subject lines and shows you how successful they'll be). 
* Jeanne Brooks:  How can we bring in the community into the content creation process to make content creators more sensitive and culturally informed?  
*

**How can we make better tools for breaking news?**
* "During the Boston Bombing, I felt like the Boston Globe was super slow on things -- so I was going to Reddit.  There's gotta be a better way to link those two, so that I have serious journalism instead of some rando's opinion.  
* During the bombing, there were a lot of people hanging around livetweeting the (police) scanner.  
* For breaking news, everybody's on Twitter, but then you're just making content for somebody else's company and they get all the money for it. 
* There's a lot of breaking news on Twitter, but as news organizations, the value we can add is the editorial vetting and added value on top of Twitter.
* Adam Schweigert/Lisa Williams  How can we make visible what the news organization is aware of, as opposed to just what they've published and verified?


**Comments & community interaction**

* I think it's interesting how Medium does comments.  They're like "We think comments are broken."
* "So instead of a wall at the bottom for you to post graffiti on, you comment on particular paragraphs -- you're responding to the thing. 
* Amanda Krauss, TX Tribune -- or, to go back to Adam's idea, how can we design comment boxes to encourage civil behavior.  We work with the Engaging News Project on this.  http://engagingnewsproject.org/
* 

**The Endless Grind of the CMS**

**How might we allow creators to see their work in context -- in device context, in web context, as they compose."

* Mike Swartz, Upstatement.  At Upstatement, we deal with people who are expert content creators, but just trying to get text into the browser and bold things is such a struggle that they can't use their instincts because the technology is beating them down at every turn.  There's a lot of unproductive friction in the content creation process -- they aren't thinking, how can I report this, they're thinking, "How can I get this to show up [on the web]?
* Lisa Williams -- I'm fascinated by online learning environments.  Like on Khan Academy, when my kids use it, they enter code on one half of the screen and immediately see the results on the left hand side.  The feedback loop is so much shorter, than using Wordpress, writing into that box, and then hitting publish.  What would change if you could see it live?  
* Show them how it looks when it gets shared on Facebook -- is the headline cut off?  Does the photo look weird?  You should be able to see a preview for lots of different platforms and devices.  
* "We just changed our content creation interface, and it looks like the control panel of the 747.  Facebook has already solved this problem -- it's so simple to post a link to something."
* Mike Workman, Boston Globe: "Facebook has solved the problem because they have to get content from their users for free -- so of course they make it easy.  But what would it look like if we could make it that easy in the newsroom?"  


**How might we improve the process of pitching stories?**
* This idea was from Sean Dillingham of KPCC

**How might we imagine the editorial output of news organization in different ways -- making more immersive content experiences?"** 
* This one is from Jeanne Brooks of Hacks/Hackers

11:06 AM ET -- wrapping up the initial brainstorming session.

12:45 PM ET -- Lightning Talks

**Amanda Krauss, Texas Tribune.  How the Texas Tribune approaches its architecture.  One big CMS? Use third party services?**

* We started out in Pangaea, a vast Django application we ran everything in -- event reservations, which didn't work well, data apps with 250,000 URLS  -- when we updated it pulled down our whole site. 
* If you're complaining about the content creation interface of Wordpress, this is much worse.  
* Eventually they broke things appart -- eventbrite for events, Mailchimp for newsletters, maybe WP for content creation (but not publishing)  Style guide in Jekyll on a Github page, Sched for event schedules. 
* "There's a discussion happening on Twitter about whether or not news organizations should be tech companies.  My answer? If your tech team is four people, the answer is no."  
* [Lisa Williams, thinking: the dream of extra advantages of building a CMS from the ground up didn't pan out.  In what circumstances does it pan out?]
* Even nontech people were nervous about us outsourcing so many of our processes, but we kept coming back to the question, "Can we do it well?" and the answer was no." 

**Chris Plummer, Dockyard**

* The Past:  In the beginning, Nolan created Atari, and it was good.  They made $2B, but then they ran out of runway in 1983, losing $583 million dollars, shrinking from 10k employees to 200 and then they died. 
* This was an industry wide extinction phenomenon. 
* What made them fall apart?  He presents an adjusted for inflation revenue chart.  Love. 
* Some people blame ET -- a huge flop.  But the actual crash was way more complicated than that (shows huge flowchart) 
* Did a thesis on the great video game crash.  Video Games industry never recovered -- never became as big as it was in 1983. 
* Telling this story was challenging -- there were a lot of parallel stories.  How could I let readers read these in a parallel way, or give them incentives to return? 
* Makes a high level view where a timeline is the navigational interface for the content. Clicking on something brings you to text that I wrote -- then there are side notes with supplementary materials.  Side notes also show you where something appears elsewhere in the corpus of material.  
* Animated sprites illustrate things in the story.  
* Wants contributors -- journalists, historians Gamers, insiders
* Wants developers to help with animations. Front end and back end.  
* Need to figure out the money -- crowdfunding, etc. 
* Is built on the Craft CMS with much added code -- so people can create side notes, media galleries. 
* It really affects how you're writing.  Is this primary, or secondary?  
*  Q: Does this industry collapse tell you anything about the industry contraction in news?  A: News has been around for a long time.  There was no business model in the 70's for video games -- they'd do things like produce 20 million cartridges on a platform with 10 million consoles.  
 

**Miranda Mulligan, Knight Lab**

* We want to make tools that people use.  There's a lot of work showing people what's possible, but doesn't work its way into the workflow of content creation in newsrooms. 
* It took a little while to get everyone on board with that, but we started with something that had a little momentum -- Timeline.JS.  (http://timeline.knightlab.com)
* One of the feature requests we always get is "can we make it vertical?" and the answer is always, "No."  (Why? -- LW)
* Timeline is not designed for hundreds of nodes.  Our mission is to support storytelling, and part of storytelling editing.  Nobody's going to read a story with 400 nodes. Reporter's Lab's Timeflow is something more for that.  
* Soundcite lets you overlay short audio clips on top of text.  Text with attached audio appears highlighted.  
* The only weird feature request we get is "can I use it for really long audio?"  You can, but we don't think it's the best use for the tool.  http://soundcite.knightlab.com
* Storymap  (http://storymap.knightlab.com) is a friendlier way to create story maps or overlays of gigapixel image.  "I like the idea of putting a map over an audio file)
* Creating the authoring tool for storymap was pretty complicated.  Timeline, interaction  (This looks super cool. -- LW)
* The metaphor for storymap is a presentation builder -- you just put slides on particular places.  
* Snapmap makes a map of your geotagged Instagram photos.  http://snapmap.knightlab.com.  Then you can export it into Storymap.  You can add foursquare checkins, etc. 
* Juxtapose lets you do those sliders, like the ones NYT had for before & after Fukushima.  http://juxtapose.knightlab.com
* People had unexpected and uses of it, not always ideal.  WE need to build into the tool a way for people to be better visual editors.
