List of attendees: http://www.snd.org/2014/10/meet-the-news-nerds-tackling-content-creation-at-sndmakes/


Miranda Mulligan, Chief of KnightLab:  "I want to make audio a more compelling experience in browser-based environments."
* What's the audio version of an animated GIF?  Simple, short, easy, Vine-like but not beholden to any service or platform? (Lisa Williams)


Pete Karl, Upstatement -How might we better accommodate the myriad changes that a story goes through over time?  
* associated media -- audio and photo management 
* Individuals in a story and their relationships
* How can we accommodate the story lifecycle?
* How do we create connections between the content? 
* MM: OpenNews hackathon had a project that Jenny 8. and Eric Price did called NewsDiffs (http://newsdiffs.org/) that tracked changes

Lisa Williams, INN:  How do we take the institutional knowledge that reporters have and make that visible to news consumers and other reporters?
* could we use something like Popolo to express the relationships between newspapers?  Show a newsmaker's network -- and stories about them at a click. 
* Amanda Krauss, Texas Tribune -- "We started out with Popolo but ended up with something very different."

Kaeti Hinck, INN:

Adam Schweigert, INN

* How could we build in docs and howtos into an interface, in a way that gives users gentle nudges to write or compose the stuff we want them to.  
*  "Here's how to crop a photo"  
*  "How might the content creation process create better journalists?"  How can it help you make a better choice, rather than writing something that an editor will come to you and say, wait, write it this way?
*  How about building in headline testing?  
*  Tito Bottita, Upstatement:  At Buzzfeed, when you try to author an item, it will show you what makes a good Buzzfeed post or headline.  (Lisa Williams: Mailchimp does this too -- it lets you test email subject lines and shows you how successful they'll be). 
* Jeanne Brooks:  How can we bring in the community into the content creation process to make content creators more sensitive and culturally informed?  
* 
How can we make better tools for breaking news?  
* "During the Boston Bombing, I felt like the Boston Globe was super slow on things -- so I was going to Reddit.  There's gotta be a better way to link those two, so that I have serious journalism instead of some rando's opinion.
